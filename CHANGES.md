#### Version 2015-05-26

* Added label "Last updated:" (defaults to not being shown!)

* Added translations to the plugin; plus default .pot file and German translations
* Added "get_the_ID()" as the default value of "post_id" parameter -- Note: in this case the Shortcode could be used as is [siu-item-updated] but within the Loop!

* Improved readme overall
* Minor formatting stuff
