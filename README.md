## Description

Very useful to output the updated date of a custom post type item on a regular page, within a widget or anywhere else... :-)

*Backstory:* I needed something like that for a client project to display the last updated date/time of a download post type on a regular content page. Since I knew, I would need the same functionality for an other existing site and maybe in future too, I just build it into a "general plugin" rather than a simple code snippet...! There were no existing plugins/ solutions out there (at least I didn't found them yet...) that fitted my needs so I had to build it myself ...

---

## Features

* Can be used in post/ page content (also post types), text widgets and also for page builder plugins etc.
* Supports date/ time format from WordPress settings by default
* Genesis Framework: easily use this in various footer/ simple edit plugins (don't forget post ID) or with the awesome Blox free/pro plugin and similar - it's that easy!
* Developer friendly: customize or extend via filters, styles and styling-friendly CSS classes
* Fully internationalized and translateable! -- German translations already packaged!
* Developed with security in mind: proper WordPress coding standards and security functions - escape all the things! :)

---

## Usage - Examples

**Example - default:**

```
[siu-item-updated]
```

Will show only date (as set in WordPress Settings > General) for the current displayed post (ID pulled via `get_the_ID()`) - has to be used within the Loop in this default state.

**Example - custom 1:**

```
[siu-item-updated post_id="363"]
```

Will show only date (as set in WordPress Settings > General) for the item of a post type with post ID "363"

**Example - custom 2:**

```
[siu-item-updated post_id="363" show_time="yes" show_sep="yes"]
```

- Will also show the time
- Will show a "separator" string between date and time values (sep)

## Shortcode Parameters

| Parameter | Description |  Default | Translateable
|:----------:|:-------------|:------:|:-------------:|
| `post_id` | ID of the post of any (public) post type | `get_the_ID()` = ID of the current displayed post -- in this case, Shortcode has to be used within the Loop!) | -- |
| `date_format` | PHP date format | setting as in WordPress Settings > General | (automatically via `date_i18n()` ) |
| `time_format` | PHP time format | setting as in WordPress Settings > General | (automatically via `date_i18n()` ) |
| `show_date` | will display updated date, by default visible! | `yes` | -- |
| `show_time` | `yes` will display time also | `no` | -- |
| `show_sep` | `yes` will display separator string | `no` | -- |
| `sep` | optional separator string | `&#x00A0;@` (that is a space plus @-symbol, like so: " @") | yes! |
| `show_label` | `yes` will display a label string before date & time values | `no` | -- |
| `label_before` | label string before date & time values | `Last updated:` (by default not shown) | yes! |
| `label_after` | label string after time value -- useful for languages like German to get time values like "9.40 Uhr" (see the "Uhr" string) | "" (not displayed) | -- |
| `class` | additional custom class for the wrapper | "" (none) | -- |
| `wrapper` | HTML wrapper element - any HTML5 wrapper is possible | `span` | -- |

## Shortcode Parameters - Bonus Shortcuts

* Shortcut for German date format to get output `d.m.Y` like `12.08.2016` (Usage: `date_format="de"`)
* Shortcut for U.S. date format to get output `Y-m-d` like `2016-08-12` (Usage: `date_format="us"`)

---

## Widget Usage

NO LONGER recommended! Widgets are outdated, I do not recommend them (and _didn't_ use them myself for lots of years already!).

* Shortcode could be used with "Text" widget -- if you have shortcodes for Widgets activated (possible via this filter: `add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' );` )
* If using extended/ advanced text widget plugins, the Shortcode usage then is already enabled automatically... :-)
* NOTE: You have to provide a unique post ID if using this outside of the Loop!

---

## Template Usage (Developers)

* Use WordPress' global "do_shortcode()" function as a template function, like so:
* `<?php do_shortcode( '[siu-item-updated post_id="123" show_label="yes"]' ); ?>` --> parameters apply like for regular Shortcode usage (see above)!
* NOTE: You have to provide a unique post ID if using this outside of the Loop!

---

## Plugin Filters (Developers)

* `siu_filter_shortcode_defaults` --> filter default values of Shortcode parameters
* `siu_filter_shortcode_item_updated` --> filter Shortcode output
* `shortcode_atts_siu-item-updated` --> lets you add new Shortcode parameters for example (= WordPress' default Shortcode filter `shortcode_atts_{$shortcode}` )

## Changelog â€“ Version History

#### ðŸŽ‰ v2.1.0 (2024-03-15)

* Detection for German locales to run plugin without translation files for German sites â€“ NOTE: you can use translations as before as well, nothing changes here. The two strings can also be modified in the Shortcode itself.
* This (single file) plugin can alternatively be used as "code snippet version". Works perfectly fine in _Code Snippets_ (free & Pro), _FluentSnippets_, _WPCode_, _Advanced Scripts_, _Scripts Organizer_ and _WPCodeBox_ â€“ NOTE: Use that way at your own risk and you have to care for updates yourself. â€“ For download see under [Installation](#installation)
